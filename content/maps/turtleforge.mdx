# Turtle Forge – Sandy Shores & Roxwood
Turtle Forge is a prominent factory complex located in Roxwood and Sandy Shores, known for its distinctive brick architecture and towering smokestack that stands as a symbol of industrious craftsmanship. Once a humble metalworking shop, it has evolved into a fully equipped refinery and fabrication facility, capable of handling everything from raw ore processing to fine mechanical assembly.

Inside, the refinery hums with the sound of furnaces and conveyor systems, ready to meet all your smelting and alloying needs. Adjacent to it lies the workshop, a haven for inventors, engineers, and tinkerers alike — complete with heavy-duty workbenches, precision tools, and enough space for even the most ambitious creations.

Surrounded by rolling hills and set against the industrial backdrop of the bay, Turtle Forge blends old-world craftsmanship with modern industry. Whether you’re refining materials, building machines, or experimenting with new designs, this facility provides the perfect environment for innovation and hard work to thrive.
