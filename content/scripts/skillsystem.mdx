# Skill & Talent System

The Skill & Talent System is a modular framework for FiveM servers that allows you to add, track, and manage player skills and talents. It is designed to be flexible, extensible, and easy to integrate into any roleplay or other gameplay modes.

**IMPORTANT:** This is a framework for you to implement - you will need to set up and configure skills and talents and then implement them into your own systems.

## Features

- **Custom Skills & Talents:** Define any number of skills (e.g., Hacking, Fishing, Trucking) and talents (e.g., Quick Learner, Night Vision).
- **Progression & XP:** Players can gain experience and level up skills through actions or events, determined by you.
- **Talent Trees:** Support for branching talent trees and unlockable abilities.
- **Server-Side & Client-Side Hooks:** Easily check a players talents and apply their modifiers on both the client & server side.
- **Persistence:** Player progress is saved and loaded automatically.
- **Configurable UI:** The frontend is completely open source, feel free to adjust it to your needs.

## Possibilities

- Create RPG-style progression for jobs, criminal activities, or hobbies.
- Unlock new abilities, perks, or access to items as players develop their characters.
- Add depth to police, EMS, mechanics, criminals and any other job roles.
- Encourage long-term player engagement and specialization.

## Example Usage

Here is a basic example of how to obtain a list of a users unlocked talents from a specific skill:

```lua
-- Obtain the source players Trucking talents
local truckingTalents = exports.strp_skills:GetSkillTalents(source, "Trucking")

-- Setting some base stats
local basePayMultiplier = 1.1
local baseLaunderAmountMultiplier = 1.075
local additionalRate = 0.0

-- Loop through the users trucking talents
for _, talent in ipairs(truckingTalents) do
    -- If the talents name begins with "extra_pay", then adjust their bonus payment
    if string.sub(talent, 1, 9) == "extra_pay" then
        amount = math.ceil(amount * basePayMultiplier)
    -- If the talents name begins with "launder_amount", then increase the amount of money laundered
    elseif string.sub(talent, 1, 14) == "launder_amount" then
        launderedAmount = math.ceil(launderedAmount * baseLaunderAmountMultiplier)
    -- If the talents name begins with "launder_rate", then increase the ratio of laundered money
    elseif string.sub(talent, 1, 12) == "launder_rate" then
        additionalRate = additionalRate + 0.1
    end
end

-- <the rest of your code that then implements these adjusted stats>
```
